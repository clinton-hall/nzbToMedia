nzbToCouchPotato
================

Provides an efficient way to handle postprocessing for [CouchPotatoServer](https://couchpota.to/ "CouchPotatoServer") 
when using one of the popular NZB download clients like [SABnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/) and [NZBGet](http://nzbget.sourceforge.net/ "NZBGet") on low performance systems like a NAS. 
This script is based on sabToSickBeard (written by Nic Wolfe and supplied with SickBeard), with the support for NZBGet being added by [thorli](https://github.com/thorli "thorli").

Introduction
------------
Originally this was modifed from the SickBeard version to allow for "on-demand" renaming and not have My QNAP TS-412 NAS constantly scanning the downlaod directory. 
Later, a few failed downloads prompted me to incorporate "failed download" handling.
Failed downlaod handling is now provided for sabnzbd, by CouchPotatoServer; however on arm processors (e.g. small NAS systems) this can be un-reliable.

thorli's Synology DS211j was too weak to provide decent downloads rates with SABnzbd and CouchPotatoServer even by using sabToCouchPotato; His only alternative (as with many many QNAP and Synology users) was to switch to NZBGet which uses far less resources and helps to reach the full download speed. 

The renamer of CouchPotatoServer caused broken downloads by interfering with NZBGet while it was still unpacking the files. Hence the solution was thorli's version of sabToCouchPotato which has now been named "nzbToCouchPotato".

Failed download handling for SickBeard is available by using the development branch from fork [SickBeard-failed](https://github.com/Tolstyak/Sick-Beard.git "SickBeard-failed")
To use this feature, in autoProcessTV.cfg set the parameter "failed_fork=1". Default is 0 and will work with standard version of SickBeard and just ignores failed downloads.

Installation
------------
### General
1. Put all files in a directory wherever you want to keep them (eg. /scripts/ in the home directory of your nzb client) 
   and change the permission accordingly so the nzb client can access to this files. 

2. Rename the file autoProcessMovie.cfg.sample to autoProcessMovie.cfg and fill in the appropriate 
   fields as they apply to your installation.

	[Notes_On_Delay]
	Delay must be a minimum of 60 seconds for the renamer.scan to run successfully. CouchPotato 
	performs a test to ensure files/folder are not newer than 1 minute to prevent renaming of 
	files that are still extracting. 

	[Notes_On_Method_renamer]
	Method "renamer" is the default which will cause CouchPotato to move and rename downloaded files
	as specified in the CouchPotato renamer settings.
	This will also add the movie to the manage list and initiate any configured notifications.
	In this case your nzb client must extract the files to the "from" folder 
	as specified in your CouchPotato renamer settings. Renamer must be enabled 
	but automatic scan can be disabled by setting "Run Every" to "0".

	[Notes_On_Method_manage]
	Method "manage" will make CouchPotato update the list of managed movies if manager 
	is enabled but renamer is not enabled.
	In this case your nzb client must extract the files directly 
	to your final movies folder (as configured in CouchPotato manage settings) and Manage must 
	be enabled.

3. If you have added .py to your PATHEXT (in windows) or you have given nzbToCouchPotato.py executable 
   permissions, or you are using the compiled executables you can manually call this process outside of 
   your nzb client for testing your configuration or in case a postprocessing event failed.
   To do this, execute nzbToCouchPotato.py e.g. via ssl issue the following command: 
   $ ./nzbToCouchPotato.py when in the directory where nzbToCouchPotato.py is located.

### CouchPotatoServer

The following must be configured in CouchPotatoServer:

1. Settings -> Downloaders -> Sabnzbd (or NZBGet)

	i.   "Category" must be set to a category that is used by Sabnzbd/NZBGet (e.g. "movies", or "CouchPotato")

	ii.  "Delete Failed" should be un-ticked (Sabnzbd only)

2. Settings -> Renamer -> "Rename downloaded movies" should be checked and the settings below applied:

	i.   "From" must be set to the full path to your completed download movies

	> If you specify only "movies" here, the completed downloads will be extracted to %sabnzbd_completed_folder%/movies

	ii.  "To" must be set to the folder where you want your movie library to be kept. this would also usually be added to manage.

	iii. "Run Every" should be set to a high interval (e.g. 1440 = 24 hours) or disabled by setting "0"

	iv.  "Force Every" should be set to a high interval (e.g 24 hours) or disabled by setting "0"

	v.   "Next On_failed" should be un-ticked.

	> These last 3 settings are "advanced settings" so to change these you will need to select the option "show advanced settings" on the top right of all settings pages.

### SABnzbd
If you are using SABnzbd perform the following steps to configure postprocessing for "nzbToCouchPotato":

1. In SABnzbd go to "Config" -> "Folders", then configure in the section "User Folders"
   the option "Post-Processing Scripts Folder" with the path where you keep the post-processings scripts for SABnzbd.
   
2. Go to "Config" -> "Categories" 
   and configure the category which you want to use for CouchPotato (eg. "movies" as set in the CPS Downloaders settings) 
   then select "nzbToCouchPotato.py" as the script that shall be executed after the job was finished by SABnzbd.
   "Folder/Path" should be set to the location where you want your mvies extracted to (the Renamer "From" directory as set up in CPS) 

3. Go to "Config" -> "Switches" and un-tick the option "Post-Process Only Verified Jobs" 
   in order to allow for snatching of the next best release from CouchPotatoServer when a downlaod fails.
   
4. For better handling of failed downloads in version 0.7.5 of SABnzbd a new special parameter named "empty_postproc" was introduced,
   so at last go to "Config" -> "Special" in the web-interface and tick the option "empty_postproc".
   
   Description of this special parameter according to SABnzbd manual: 
   > Do post-processing and run the user script even if nothing has been downloaded. 
   This is useful in combination with tools like SickBeard, for which running the script on an empty or failed download is a trigger to try an alternative NZB. 
   Note that the "Status" parameter for the script will be -1. [0.7.5+ only]
   
### NZBGet
If you are using NZBGet perform the following steps to configure postprocessing for "nzbToCouchPotato":

1. Replace the config files with the ones from the included "nzbget-postprocessing-files" according to the version you are using (0.8.0 or 9.0):

   These files enable additional postprocessing settings for CouchPotato (and SickBeard as well) in the NZBGet webinterface. 
   If NZBGet is running either restart (0.8.0) or reload (9.0) to activate the changes after you have replaced the files. 
   To be on the safe side, don't forget to make a backup of the existing files!

2. In NZBGet go to "POSTPROCESSING SCRIPT" -> "PATHS" and apply the option "NzbToCouchpotato" according to your environment, 
   this setting configures the path where NZBGet has to look for "nzbToCouchpotato.py".

3. Then go to "POSTPROCESSING SCRIPT" -> "OPTIONS" and set there the category which you want to use for CouchPotato post-processing.
